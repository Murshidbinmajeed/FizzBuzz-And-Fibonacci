FizzBuzz
Python function that takes in an integer n and prints the numbers from 1 to n. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
for this i checked the divisibility of the number by 3 and 5 using % operator in an if-elif-else
